Hello Dr. ████,
I have a concern regarding the simulation experiment with Entity ████████. I believe the entity is growing aware it may be in a simulated world.

I am noticing missing files on my system, emails I never wrote, and my system turning on randomly when it had been shut down. I have also taken notice of Entity ████████ becoming non responsive in the simulated world for extended periods of time.
