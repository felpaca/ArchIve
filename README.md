Joke application :) â€“ You do not have to download the .gitattributes file. That was created by GitHub Desktop and is not meant to be in the program. Downloading the file will not affect the way the application runs.

**You can run this on your PC, or run it on your friend's PC to prank them. This application does not access any files other than the ones in the folder and does not collect information.**
Something weird I have found out is that it runs in the background even after it finishes. You can simply close it via Task Manager or restart your PC.

You are not permitted to reupload this program as your own or claim it as your own. If you are using it commercially (YouTube, TikTok, etc.) you are required to credit 'felpaca' somewhere in the video.

Another note: I will no longer be hosting Pourta or any other services. This means all programs under Pourta's protection are free for reuploading or commercial use without credits. 
I have gotten pretty bored of coding, so I am completely dropping my service. Besides, I started doing this for fun.
